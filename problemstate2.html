<p>Sinhagad Fort, near Pune, is a historic hill fortress famous for its role in Maratha history, 
especially the 1670 Battle of Sinhagad where Tanaji Malusare died capturing it from Mughals,
 leading Chhatrapati Shivaji to rename it "Lion's Fort" (Sinhagad from Kondhana). 
Today, it's a popular trekking spot offering panoramic Sahyadri views, historic ruins
 like Pune & Kalyan gates, temples, water cisterns, and local Maharashtrian food (Pithla-Bhakri).
 The best time to visit is October to April for cooler weather, and it's a must-visit for 
trekkers and history lovers, despite potential traffic/parking issues.</p>
