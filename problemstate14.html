<p>Raigad, seen in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India, is a hill fort located in the city of Mahad.
 It is one of the strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau and was historically referred to as Rairee or Rairy fort.[1]

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha ruler, along with his chief engineer Hiroji Indulkar, 
did the construction and development of various buildings and structures, including Raigad. 
In 1674, after being crowned the king of the Maratha Kingdom of the Konkan, Shivaji Maharaj 
chose Raigad as the capital of his Hindavi Swaraj.[2]

Located at an elevation of 820 metres (2,700 ft) above its base and 1,356 m (4,449 ft) 
above sea level within the Sahyadri mountain range, the fort offers views of the surrounding area.
The fort was home to around 1,550 people having an average family size of 5 people.
Accessing the fort requires ascending approximately 1,737 steps. Alternatively, 
visitors can opt for the Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway spanning 750 m (2,460 ft)
 in length and reaching a height of 400 m (1,300 ft), which conveniently transports them
 from the ground to the fort in just four minutes.
